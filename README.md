# Nybble World

Solve logic puzzles by guiding nybbles through a custom cellular automaton.

Each level gives you:

- one or more input values (hex values 0-F)
- a target output value
- a grid where nybbles move automatically each tick
- a limited number of ticks per “wave”

You place wires to route the nybbles across the grid. When two nybbles collide, they combine into a new value based on the automaton’s rules (e.g., logical NOR). Use routing, timing, and collisions to produce the correct value before the wave ends.

This game was developed as part of [Game Off 2025](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2025), a game jam "challenging individuals and teams to build a game during the month of November". This year's theme was "WAVES".
