# Octoland

Solve logic puzzles by guiding octals through a custom cellular automaton. You place wires to route the octals across the grid. In the overworld you navigate a character to the next level.

This game was developed as part of [Game Off 2025](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2025), a game jam "challenging individuals and teams to build a game during the month of November". This year's theme was "WAVES".
